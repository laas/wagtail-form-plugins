# Wagtail LAAS Forms

A form app based on wagtail.contrib.forms with some extra features:

- form builder fields are defined with a StreamField __*__;
- allow conditional fields.

> __*__ This feature has been suggested to Wagtail core on [this pull request](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pull/12287) and so should be removed from this project if the PR is merged.
